# Tech Quiz Test Suite

## Description

This project enhances a fully functioning Tech Quiz application by adding comprehensive testing using Cypress for both component and end-to-end (E2E) tests. The application was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. Users can take a quiz of ten random questions and view their final score.

The testing suite ensures reliability and robustness through automated testing of all user interactions and component behaviors.
